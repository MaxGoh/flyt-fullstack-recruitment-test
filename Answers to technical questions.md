#### How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

I roughly spent 10-15 hours on this project. The tedious part was especially in utilising TypeScript to ensure all components of the project are Type-Safed.
I did not focus on the animation part as seen on (https://order.gbk.co.uk/)[Website], as well as not cloning the design to an exact T. My focus on this application was to ensure scalable, minimal bug, reusable components within the minimal time that I spent.

I'm pretty proud of what I have built within this time. If I have more time, I would skin up the UI/UX so that it would be more user-friendly. For example, when adding or removing items, I can add some sort of loading and success animation for indication that the functions are being processed.

#### How would you improve the Flyt APIs that you just used?
